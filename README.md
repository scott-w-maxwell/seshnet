This a web application for communicating

## Some General Goals

### Decentralized:
The main goal of this open source project is to create a web application that can easily be self-hosted on a computer with low computing power. The point of this is to create decrentralized system that doesn't have one specific point of control. Each server can implement their own policies.

### Private:
Communication on this application should be as private as possible without sacrificing too much usability and functionality.

### Convenient:
From both the user's and host's point of view, the app should feel easy and usable.

### Free:
The service should be free for all users.

## Eventual Goal

An eventual goal is to create a centralized place to switch between the servers (or sessions).
This application is the bare bones and all that should be needed, but to have a website that can be used to access other decentralized servers would help improve the user experience. I'm still brain storming how this could be accomplished...
